            <h1 class="aboutSubtitle">Our Work: What are we doing?</h1>
            <p class="aboutText">Novel promotes public health to cultivate a health conscious, competent, and safe population. Our platform deepens the perception of public health, thereby emphasizing the need for urgent action to prevent looming crises and heal legacies of injustice. Furthermore, Novel illuminates solutions-- some may be fanstical scientific developments, some may require bureaucratic action, and others may demand organizing to implement swift policy changes-- but all are united in their bold innovation and optimism about the future. We believe that highlighting these audacious ideas and the valiant leaders behind them will drive the field of public health, and the health of our global community forward.</p>

            <h1 class="aboutSubtitle">Our Goals: What do we hope to accomplish?</h1>
            <p class="aboutText">Novel does more than highlight the gutsy innovators driving public health forward, it fosters horizontal connection among them, and induces conversation about impending health crises. By galvanizing conversation, our organization stimulates inclusive growth of public health leaders eager to tackle the fieldâ€™s most pressing issues. The organic dialogue on public health entrepreneurship and innovation will build a community invested in improving our public
                health systems. We know that this community buy-in will incentivize film makers to produce more thought-provoking public health films.</p>

Here at Novel, we call these films Realistic Hollywood and Futuristic Reality. We envision these films as catalysts, sparking change in our future leaders. We see a future of public health that is ever changing and adaptive. In this future, we are the founders of tomorrow.</p>
