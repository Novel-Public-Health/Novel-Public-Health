                <p class="aboutText">Novel is an innovative and multidimensional public health media company that
                    explores public health through film. It functions as a video streaming, digital media, and online networking
                    company dedicated to expanding the public health film industry. Here at Novel, we focus on
                    highlighting
                    urgent public health concerns in the local, national, and global community. To our knowledge, we are
                    the
                    first of its kind.</p>

            <div id="novelEstablished" class="aboutDivRight">
                <h2 class="aboutSubtitle">Why was this established?</h2>
                <p class="aboutText">Novel was created in response to the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
                    pandemic. The pandemic has highlighted now more than ever, the importance of public health and
                    stability
                    of public health systems. Modern public health strategies are geared towards cross sector
                    collaboration
                    and interdisciplinary approaches. With this same intent, Novel is focused on the intersection of
                    media,
                    film, and public health. As a result, Novel is dedicated to increasing health literacy, public
                    health
                    awareness, and advocacy for complex public health issues.</p>

                <h2 class="aboutSubtitle">What is our intent?</h2>
                <p class="aboutText">Novel features inventive, groundbreaking, and engaging motion pictures to the
                    public.
                    We are invested in films that stretch the imagination, understanding, and vision of public health.
                    All
                    films hosted on Novel are authentic pieces capable of catching the attention of audiences across the
                    globe.</p>

                <h1 class="aboutSubtitle">Our Work</h1>
                <p class="aboutText">Novel promotes public health to cultivate a health conscious, competent, and safe
                    population. Our platform deepens the perception of public health, thereby emphasizing the need for
                    urgent action to prevent looming crises and heal legacies of injustice. Furthermore, Novel
                    illuminates
                    solutions-- some may be fanstical scientific developments, some may require bureaucratic action, and
                    others may demand organizing to implement swift policy changes-- but all are united in their bold
                    innovation and optimism about the future. We believe that highlighting these audacious ideas and the
                    valiant leaders behind them will drive the field of public health, and the health of our global
                    community forward.</p>

            <div class="aboutDivRight">
                <h1 class="aboutSubtitle">Our Goals </h1>
                <p class="aboutText">Novel does more than highlight the gutsy innovators driving public health forward,
                    it
                    fosters horizontal connection among them, and induces conversation about impending health crises. By
                    galvanizing conversation, our organization stimulates inclusive growth of public health leaders
                    eager to
                    tackle the fieldâ€™s most pressing issues. The organic dialogue on public health entrepreneurship and
                    innovation will build a community invested in improving our public
                    health systems. We know that this community buy-in will incentivize film makers to produce more
                    thought-provoking public health films.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="aboutDivLeft">
                <h1 class="aboutSubtitle">Our Hope </h1>
                <p class="aboutText">As we expand, we envision a whole new genre of emerging film. As innovators, we are
                    motivated to curate realistic films with a Hollywood experience. Here at Novel, we call these films
                    Realistic Hollywood and Futuristic Reality. We envision these films as catalysts, sparking change in
                    our
                    future leaders. We see a future of public health that is ever changing and adaptive. In this future,
                    we
                    are the founders of tomorrow.</p>
